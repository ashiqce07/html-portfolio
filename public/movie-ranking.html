<h1>The Best Movies According to Ashiq</h1>
<h2>My Top Three Movies of all-time</h2>
<hr /> 
<h3>Cast Away</h3>
<p>A movie to display the will and determination of human nature. <br />
    A man can do anything if he wants, even there is no way he will <br /> find ways untill his last breath. 
</p>
<h3>Avengers: Endgame</h3>
<p>Grapgics and actions and in between some hard truth to relaize.</p>
<h3>Fast and Furious</h3>
<p>Just watching for fun, nothing else.</p>
<h3>The Ninth Gate</h3>
<p>A story of satanic culture. It showed that desperation doesn't always get you to your desired outcome.
    <br />
    Jony Deep played a interesting character in this movie.
